# JuliaCon 2018 - Building a strong foundation for geospatial innovation

This [repository](https://github.com/visr/JuliaCon2018-JuliaGeo) contains the slides and demo code used in the presentation. The talk was also recorded and is available here: https://youtu.be/CD4EiDNeNg4.

The raster data used in the presentation was obtained from here: https://environment.data.gov.uk/ds/survey/#/survey?grid=NY31. Some further processing was done to combine the downloaded data to a single tile.

## Description
This talk will showcase what is possible with the JuliaGeo related packages, with the aim to get you started if you want to do geospatial analysis in Julia. Making full use of the strengths of Julia, examples are shown of that would be either too slow or too much work in other languages.
